				<p>With snow-capped peaks, primeval forests, and active volcanoes, New Zealand’s stunning natural diversity has played a staring role in movies like Avatar and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It’s not just movie directors who are drawn here; outdoors enthusiasts also come in droves to trek mountains, ski glaciers, abseil into limestone caves and experience white-knuckle rides down river rapids. <br />
					<br />
					With Maori society dating back over 700 years, and English settlement almost 200, Aotearoa, as New Zealand is traditionally known, is a place of diverse cultural riches too. At the top of the North Island, discover the “City of Sails”, Auckland, then lose yourself in the fabulous Bay of Islands. Just to the south, the geysers and bubbling mud pools of Rotorua await.<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					 Visit the Whakarewarewa Thermal Village to learn how the Maori coexist with the unpredictable nature of the landscape. Near the North Island’s center, hike through herb fields and forests near the active volcanoes of Tongariro National Park.

				</h4>

				<p>Postcard-perfect scenery, café-backed beaches and cities stacked with big-name sights – long-legged Italy manages to pack a lot into its borders. And no matter which part of the boot you plump for, you’ll find top-drawer food, fine wines and a healthy dose of la dolce vita. Italy is the home of three active volcanoes in Europe. <br />
					<br />
					Italy’s most northerly regions are a different story altogether. Here, you’ll see some of Mother Nature’s best work, from glistening lakes to soaring mountains. When it comes to Italian lakes holidays, Garda, Como and Maggiore are the big names. Their glass-clear shores are fringed with forested slopes, tree-lined promenades and lavish villas. This spectacular scenery’s ramped up by the Dolomites – a cloud-tickling mountain range, where snow-crowned peaks mingle with village-lined valleys. <br />
					<br />
					In the north, romantic Venice reigns supreme, while nearby Lido di Jesolo supplies the sands. A bit further south lies Campania, home to the dramatic Amalfi Coast and cliff-hugging towns like Sorrento, Ravello and Positano.

				<h4 class='country'>Saint Lucia
				</h4>
				<article>
				<p> This tropical treasure is much more than a beach retreat. Soaring volcanic peaks, lush rainforests and multi-coloured waterfalls are just some of the highlights. Resort-wise, luxury is St Lucia’s middle name. Pick from boutique hideaways set in secluded hills, or sprawling hotels with panoramic private beaches. <br />
					<br />
					North and south of the island are two distinct cultural hubs. Rodney Bay in the north boasts a pristine, modern marina full of seafront bars and upmarket restaurants. Soufriere in the south is infused with retro Caribbean vibes – you’ll find candy-coloured villages, barbeque stalls by the roadside and fish fry-ups on the beach. <br />
					<br />
					St Lucia’s unspoilt landscape calls out to be explored in the most adventurous way. You can zip-line through the rainforest, hike the Piton Mountains or cruise through the world’s only drive-in volcano. There’s every kind of watersport to try, from kayaking and windsurfing to deep-sea fishing and jet-skiing.
